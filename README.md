#About

A friend and I participated in HackRU, a 24-hour hackathon hosted by Rutgers University, and won 3rd place. Our hack was called FriendTrend â€” a chrome extension that allows you to view trending topics based off the tweets of the people you are following. The hack was created using PHP, MongoDB, Javascript, and the Twitter API. 

FriendTrend was created shortly before Twitter introduced "Tailored Trends" which served the same purpose as this hack.
